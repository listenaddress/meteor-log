# Log

This is an experiment to build an open, social chat app with Meteor. We have lots of code working but thereâ€™s still work left.

## Code that's working

- Start public or private chat logs
- Integrate Github and Trello
- Upload files
- Browse & join all public logs
- Tag users
- Recieve notifications when you're tagged or when someone joins a log you started

## To do

- Implement message pagination
- Clean up message loading UI
- Test initial use cases
